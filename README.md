## About The Project


Anuraksha is a technology-driven initiative aimed at addressing the shortcomings of existing emergency response systems by creating a locally integrated network of rapid responders. Leveraging accessible technology, CERN facilitates immediate assistance during crises, ensuring swift and accurate responses to individuals in distress within local communities.

## Objective

- To develop a robust local responders network leveraging accessible technology, addressing the deficiencies in existing emergency support systems. 

- Providing features such as SOS alerting with location tracking, a rapid volunteer response network, and direct connection to emergency contacts, our solution aims to ensure swift help during emergencies.
 
- Incorporating data storage for future analysis and generating heatmaps of high-risk areas, we seek to enhance long-term prevention efforts and contribute to community-wide safety improvements. 

- Keeping contacts informed, rallying nearby helpers swiftly, and promoting targeted interventions for better emergency management.
