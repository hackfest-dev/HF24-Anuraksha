## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)



Existing support systems fall short during emergencies, leaving individuals and their close ones overwhelmed. ⁤⁤Immediate help is necessary, yet lacking. ⁤⁤There is a need for a network of rapid responders within local communities, facilitated by accessible technology. 
Existing emergency systems remain fragmented, underutilized, and lacking integration, hindering faster and more reliable assistance where it's most needed. ⁤
